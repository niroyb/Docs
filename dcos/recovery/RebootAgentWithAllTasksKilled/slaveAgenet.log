 Failed to perform recovery: Failed to recover framework 83a3baa4-88ec-4cae-97ed-9c16f1ec694f-0001: 
                             Failed to recover executor 'simplejob.2d02eb81-02f1-11e8-a981-0e38bb9778bd': 
                             Failed to find latest run of executor 'simplejob.2d02eb81-02f1-11e8-a981-0e38bb9778bd': 
                             Failed to get attributes for file 'latest': The system cannot find the file specified.

If recovery failed due to a change in configuration and you want to
keep the current agent id, you might want to change the
`--reconfiguration_policy` flag to a more permissive value.

To restart this agent with a new agent id instead, do as follows:
rm -f C:\DCOS\mesos\work\meta\slaves\latest
This ensures that the agent does not recover old live executors.

If you use the Docker containerizer and think that the Docker
daemon state is broken, you can try to clear it. But be careful:
these commands will erase all containers and images from this host,
not just those started by Mesos!
docker kill $(docker ps -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rmi $(docker images -q)

Finally, restart the agent.
