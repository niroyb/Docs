// Instructions for setting up Linux VM

Pull down the repository
Install Go (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-go-1-6-on-ubuntu-16-04)
Try to build gogcs and runcclient (use “go get” to install missing dependencies)
Install runc (“sudo apt install runc”)
Make busybox bundle rootfs in runcclient’s bundle directory (https://github.com/opencontainers/runc, read the “Creating an OCI Bundle” README section)
                NOTE: You only need to do this if you’re planning on playing with the runcclient or running its tests
                NOTE: There’s already a config, so you just have to create the rootfs
                NOTE: You’ll have to install docker with “sudo apt install docker.io”, although this should be able to be removed afterwards with “sudo apt remove docker.io”
                NOTE: If the docker daemon won’t start, you may have to run the docker commands as sudo
NOTE: If docker says it can’t find the specified page, you may have to put the $(…) portion of the command in quotation marks

Installing runc should be the only step necessary to set up if you aren’t also building the code

// Host setup
Add GCS communication service GUIDs to the host by running the following reg files
"C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\RS3 Demo Setup Instructions.reg"

Run MockHCS on the host

C:\MockHCS> runserver.bat sockettest.exe
